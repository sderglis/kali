# kali
Repo for kali linux distros

08 Mar 2016

This is my first GitHub repo. I'm teaching myself GitHub as part of a larger side-project to learn software development and deployment into cloud environments. I am starting with AWS cloud integration. 

The goal is to develop code that will automate the deployment and configuration of the Kali Linux distribution on an AWS EC2 instance.
